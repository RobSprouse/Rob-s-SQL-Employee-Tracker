## Installation

This application requires Node.js to run. Please visit https://nodejs.org/en/ to download Node.js if it is not already installed on your computer.

This application depends on connecting to an existing MySql server, either locally or over the internet. Please visit https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ to download MySQL if it is not already installed on your computer. Once your computer hosts the MySql server, you can modify the connection parameters in the `db/connection.js` file to connect to your server.

To install this application, clone the repository, navigate to its directory in the terminal, and run `npm install` in the command line to install the required dependencies.

If you want to interact with a database that contains sample seeded data, run the `sampleSeed.sql` schema file located in the `config` directory to create the database and tables with seeded data. This file will drop the employee_tracker database if it already exists, so be careful if you have already created the database and want to keep the data. If you are unfamiliar with running MySql scripts, please click on the following link to learn: [MySQL docs | Executing SQL Statements from a Text File](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-batch-commands.html)

## Usage

After following the installation instructions, while still in the applications directory within the terminal, run `npm start` in the command line to start the application. This will create an `employee_tracker` database on your MySql server, if it doesn't exist, and populate it with the tables `department`, `role`, and `employee`, if they don't exist. The application will then prompt you with a series of questions to view, add, delete, and update employees, roles, and departments.
